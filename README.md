# hacks
In the spirit of jwz's "marginal hacks" section of
https://www.jwz.org/hacks/, just some lightweight stuff.

## epoch.pl
Convert a time in seconds-since-epoch to human-readable in the
local time zone.

## h.pl
Poor man's version of the `df(1)`/`du(1)` `-h` flag so that you can do
math/`sort(1)` with the `-k` flag, but still get human-readable
output.
